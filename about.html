                <p>In 2006, even before we had computer with internet at our home, I discovered how to style webpages 
                    using CSS and not long after that I was building websites with HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and Adobe Photoshop
                    for everyone who needed one. I loved every aspect of it, from designing logos to scripting in PHP. </p>

                <p>During my studies (Computer Science) I spend uncountably many hours programming in Python and I learned many other cool things like machine learning, (genomic) data 
                    science, linguistics and statistics.</p>
                    <p>
                After my graduation I was working as a (Python) research support programmer, but as a result of the corona 
                    lockdown my projects gradually switched from Python to JavaScript in order to support 
                    web-based research and soon I rediscovered my true passion. For me, digital development and design is like magic: starting 
                    with absolutely nothing you can create the most beautiful and awesome things.</p>
                
                <p>Currently I design and develop for the web on a daily basis, 
                    which includes UX and graphic design, developing the front-ends for 
                    websites, dashboards and API's, building small WordPress websites and search engine optimization.

                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>I live in Leiden with my two rabbits Nijn & Rakker, who like to keep me awake at night. 
                    I have too many house plants, I love nature, I like playing board games and I'm afraid of goats.
